    SRFI 186: Transcoders and transcoded ports</a>, Jim Rees reported
    a difference between SRFI 186 and R6RS with respect to end-of-line
    translation.  John wants to make this SRFI match R6RS in that
    regard, but since this SRFI has been finalized, it's too late to
    change it.  Instead, John intends eventually to submit a
    replacement SRFI that corrects this discrepancy.  When that's
    ready, he'll withdraw this one and we'll place a link to the new

<h1>Abstract</h1>

This is an extract from the R6RS that documents its support for transcoders and transcoded ports.
These provide a hook into the Scheme port system from below, allowing the
creation of textual ports that provide non-default encoding and decoding from
arbitrary binary ports.  It has been lightly edited to fit R7RS style.

<h1>Rationale</h1>

<p>When reading from (or writing to) files, devices, pipes, sockets,
or other sources (or sinks) of data, it's sometimes useful or necessary
to handle textual data that are encoded differently from the system default encoding.</p>

<p>This can be done at a level above Scheme ports, but with some
loss in convenience.  In particular, the high-level Scheme procedures
like <code>read</code>, <code>write</code>, and <code>display</code>
only accept port arguments.  By making it possible to create transcoded ports
that accept a binary port and return a corresponding textual port,
convenience is served.</p>

<h1>Specification</h1>

<p>
Several different character encoding schemes exist that describe standard ways to
encode characters and strings as byte sequences and to decode those
sequences.
Within this document, a <em>codec</em> is an immutable Scheme
object that represents a Unicode or similar encoding scheme.</p>
<p>
An <em>end-of-line style</em> is a symbol that
describes how a textual port transcodes representations of
line endings.
The symbols <code>lf</code> and <code>none</code> mean
that no newline conversion is done.
The symbol <code>crlf</code> means that after decoding
with a codec, the sequence <code>CRLF</code>, that is,
a <code>#\return</code> followed by a <code>#\newline</code>,
is replaced by <code>#\newline</code>.
Correspondingly, the reverse is done before encoding.
Implementations may support additional symbols.</p>

<p>
An <em>error-handling mode</em> is a symbol that
specifies the behavior
of textual I/O operations in the presence of encoding or decoding
errors.</p>
<p>
If a textual input operation encounters an invalid or incomplete
character encoding,
then if the error-handling mode is <code>replace</code>, the replacement
it is treated as the character U+FFFD (or if that character is
not representable by the implementation or is not permitted in
strings, then by the character U+003F (question mark).
But if the error-handling mode is <code>raise</code>,
an error satisfying <code>i/o-decoding-error?</code> is signaled,
an appropriate number of bytes are ignored, and decoding
continues with the following bytes.</p>
<p>
If a textual output operation encounters a character it cannot encode,
then if the error-handling mode is <code>replace</code>, a codec-specific
replacement character is emitted by the transcoder, and encoding
continues with the next character.
The replacement character is U+FFFD for transcoders whose codec
can encode this character, but is U+003F (question mark)
if it cannot.
But if the error-handling mode is <code>raise</code>, an
an error satisfying <code>i/o-encoding-error?</code> is raised,
and encoding continues with the next character.
</p>
<p>
Implementations may support additional symbols.
<p>
A <em>transcoder</em> is an immutable Scheme object that combines
a codec, an end-of-line style, and an error-handling mode.
Each transcoder represents some specific bidirectional (but not
necessarily lossless), possibly stateful translation between byte
sequences and Unicode characters and strings.
Every transcoding can decode bytes as characters and encode characters as bytes.
</p>
<h2>Procedures</h2>
<div><code>(make-codec <i>string</i>)</code></div>
<p>Returns a codec representing the character encoding scheme
whose standard name is the case-insensitive string <i>string</i>.</p>
<p>Standard character encoding names for HTML can be found at
<a href="https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#names-and-labels">
the WHATWG encoding specification</a>, and implementations
should recognize and support all of these.
There are a total of 39 encodings, which have between them
218 standard names.  Note that the "replacement" codec
signals an error whenever it is used.
Additional encoding names listed at
<a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets/character-sets.xhtml">
the IANA page on character sets</a>
may also be recognized and supported.</p>
<p>If <code>make-codec</code> is called
on a string that the implementation does not support,
an error is signaled.</p>

<div><code>(latin-1-codec<i></i>)</code></div>
<div><code>(utf-8-codec<i></i>)</code></div>
<div><code>(utf-16-codec<i></i>)</code></div>
<p>
These are predefined codecs for the ISO 8859-1, UTF-8,
and UTF-16 encoding schemes.</p>
<p>
A call to any of these procedures returns a value that is equal in the
sense of <code>eqv?</code> to the result of any other call to the same
procedure.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<div><code>(native-eol-style<i></i>)</code></div>
<p>
Returns the default end-of-line style of the underlying platform, typically
<code>lf</code> on Unix and <code>crlf</code> on Windows.
</p>
<div><code>(i/o-decoding-error?<i> obj</i>)</code></div>

<p>
Returns <code>#t</code> if <i>obj</i> is
an exception raised when one of the operations for
textual input from a port encounters a sequence of bytes that cannot
be decoded into a character or string by the port's transcoder.</p>
<p>
When such an exception is raised, the port's position is past
the invalid encoding.
</p>
<div><code>(i/o-encoding-error?<i> obj</i>)</code></div>
<p>
Returns <code>#t</code> if <i>obj</i> is
an exception raised when one of the operations for
textual output to a port encounters a character that cannot be
encoded into bytes by the port's transcoder.</p>
<div><code>(i/o-encoding-error-char<i> i/o-encoding-condition</i>)</code></div>
<p>
Returns the character that could not be encoded
when the condition <i>i/o-encoding-condition</i> was signaled.
</p>
<div><code>(make-transcoder<i> codec eol-style handling-mode</i>)</code></div>
<p>
Returns a transcoder with the behavior specified by its arguments.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<div><code>(native-transcoder<i></i>)</code></div>
<p>
Returns an implementation-dependent transcoder that represents a
possibly locale-dependent &ldquo;native&rdquo; transcoding.
This should be equivalent to the transcoder employed by
Scheme operations that open textual ports.</p>
<div><code>(<a id="node_idx_650"></a>transcoded-port<i> binary-port transcoder</i>)</code><span style="margin-left: .5em">&zwnj;</span><span style="margin-left: .5em">&zwnj;</span>procedure&nbsp;</div>
<p>
Returns a new textual port with the specified <i>transcoder</i>
from <i>binary-port</i>.
The new textual port's state is largely the same as
that of <i>binary-port</i>.
If <i>binary-port</i> is an input port, the new textual
port will be an input port and
will decode the bytes of <i>binary-port</i>.
If <i>binary-port</i> is an output port, the new textual
port will be an output port and
will write encoded characters to <i>binary-port</i>.
<p>
It is an error to call this procedure on <i>binary-port</i>
after it has been read from or written to.
It is also an error to read or write on <i>binary-port</i>
after calling this procedure.
</p>
<div><code>(bytevector-&gt;string<i> bytevector transcoder</i>)</code></div>
<p>
Returns the string that results from decoding the
<i>bytevector</i> according to the input direction of the transcoder.
</p>
<div><code>(string-&gt;bytevector<i> string transcoder</i>)</code></div>
<p>
Returns the bytevector that results from encoding the
<i>string</i> according to the output direction of the transcoder.
</p>
<p>
</p>

<h1>Implementation</h1>

<p>Every conforming R6RS implementation, including at least Chez, Guile, IronScheme,
Larceny, Racket, and Vicare, already provides these procedures
with the exception of <code>make-codec</code>, as there is no portable way to create
a codec for a named encoding in R6RS
in the <code>(rnrs io ports)</code> library.
Therefore, no implementation is provided here, especially since 
a portable implementation is not possible.</p>

<h1>Acknowledgements</h1>

This would have been much more difficult without the R6RS team,
who produced a good-enough (as opposed to perfect) design
that John was happy to adopt.  Thanks also to Mikel More,
who convinced him of the necessity of having transcoded ports in R7RS-large.
